       	You acknowledge that this Privacy Policy is part of our Site Terms of Use, and by accessing or using our site, you agree to be bound by all of its terms and conditions. If you do not agree to these terms, please do not access or use this site.<br><br>
		We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time. Such changes, modifications, additions or deletions shall be effective immediately upon notice thereof, which may be given by means including, but not limited to issuing an e-mail to the e-mail address listed by registered users and posting the revised Policy on this page. You acknowledge and agree that it is your responsibility to maintain a valid e-mail address as a registered user, review this site and this Policy periodically and to be aware of any modifications. Your continued use of the site after such modifications will constitute your: (a) acknowledgment of the modified Policy; and (b) agreement to abide and be bound by the modified Policy.<br><br>
		<b>What information do we collect from you?</b><br><br>
		In order to better provide you with our numerous services, we collect two types of information about our users: Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information. Our primary goal in collecting information from you is to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience while using our site.<br><br>
		Personally Identifiable Information: This refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who you are. When you engage in certain activities on this site, such as filling the ‘Contact Us’ Form or the ‘Content Download’ Form we may ask that you provide us personal information, such as your first and last name, mailing address (including zip code), e-mail address, employer, job title and department, telephone and facsimile numbers, and other personal identifying information. It is completely optional for you to engage in these activities. We do not have provisions for website users to create any membership accounts and passwords. We also do NOT collect sensitive personal information of website users such as financial information such as bank account or credit card or debit card or other payment instrument details, physical, physiological and mental health condition, sexual orientation, medical records and history and biometric information.<br><br>
		Non-Personally Identifiable Information: This refers to information that does not by itself identify a specific individual. We gather certain information about you based upon where you visit on our site in several ways. This information is compiled and analyzed on both a personal and an aggregated basis. This information may include the Web site’s Uniform Resource Locator (“URL”) that you just came from, which URL you go to next, what browser you are using, and your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address. An URL is the global address of documents and other resources on the World Wide Web. An IP address is an identifier for a computer or device on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (“TCP/IP”) network, such as the World Wide Web. Networks like the World Wide Web use the TCP/IP protocol to route information based on the IP address of the destination. In other words, an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the web, allowing web servers to locate and identify your computer. Computers require IP addresses in order for users to communicate on the Internet.<br><br>
		<b>Where do we collect information from you and how do we use it?</b><br><br>
		We do not collect any Personally Identifiable Information about you unless you voluntarily provide it to us. You provide certain Personally Identifiable Information to us when you fill out forms on our website such as the ‘Contact Us’ form or the ‘Content Download’ form, send e-mail messages, submit forms or transmit other information by telephone or letter. We may also collect information from you at other points on our site that state that such information is being collected.<br><br>
	In addition, we may also collect, or our digital ad vendors may collect, certain Non-Personally Identifiable Information. This information is ultimately stored in the form of store categories, and, in some cases, specific URLs. We use your IP address to diagnose problems with our servers, software, to administer our site, to gather demographic information and to track visitors to our website through Non-Personally Identifiable Information and serve them our own advertisements on third party websites. We do not serve any third party advertisements or our own advertisements on our website.<br><br>
	We will use your Personally Identifiable Information to provide our services to you, as required by our agreements with you and to enhance the operation of our site, fill orders, improve our marketing and promotional efforts, statistically analyze site use, improve our product and service offerings, and customize our site’s content, layout, and services. We may use Personally Identifiable Information to email you regarding requests made by you through our website, for answering your queries as submitted through our website, and for informing you about the OpexAI products and services. We may also use Personally Identifiable Information to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our agreements with you, including our Site Terms of Use, Sales Terms and Conditions, and this Private Policy.<br><br>
	<b>With whom do we share your information?</b><br><br>
	We do not sell, trade, or rent your Personally Identifiable Information to others. We do provide some of our services through contractual arrangements with affiliates, services providers, partners and other third parties. For instance, we have contractual arrangements with service providers who capture and store data collected through the forms that are filled by visitors to our website. The service providers are contractually bound not to share Personally Identifiable Information collected from visitors to our website with anyone else. We and our service partners use your Personally Identifiable Information to operate our website and better serve the visitors to our website.<br><br>
	Occasionally we may be required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide Personally Identifiable Information to the appropriate governmental authorities. We will disclose Personally Identifiable Information upon receipt of a court order, subpoena, or to cooperate with a law enforcement investigation. We fully cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use our services for illegal activities. We reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we in good faith believe to be unlawful.<br><br>
	We may also provide Non-Personally Identifiable Information about our customers’ sales, traffic patterns, and related site information to third party advertisers, but these statistics do not include any Personally Identifiable Information.<br><br>
	<b>How can you update or correct your Personally Identifiable Information?</b><br><br>
	We believe you should have the ability to access and edit the Personally Identifiable Information that you have provided to us. You may access and change any of your Personally Identifiable Information that you sent us at any time by writing to us or sending us an email at:<br><br>
	OpexAI Business consulting LLP.<br>
	14-1-97/2/2, New Allahpur, Borabanda,<br>
	Hyderabad – 500018, IND<br>
	Email: consult@opexai.com <br><br>
	Please include your name, address, and/or e-mail address when you contact us.<br><br>
	We encourage you to promptly update your Personally Identifiable Information if it changes. We do not keep any data back ups or archive any Personally Identifiable Information. However, if you fill a form on our website like the ‘Contact Us’ Form or the ‘Content Download’ Form, that data will be available to us and will never be deleted from our systems.<br><br>
	<b>What are your choices regarding collection, use, and distribution of your information?</b><br><br>
	We may, from time to time, send you e-mail regarding our products and services. In addition, if you indicated upon filling forms on our website that you are interested in receiving offers or information from us and our partners, we may occasionally send you direct mail about products and services that we feel may be of interest to you. If you do not want to receive such mailings, simply tell us when you give us your personal information. Or, you can email us to let us know that you no longer want to receive such offers and mailings.<br><br>
	You also have choices with respect to cookies, as described below. By modifying your browser preferences, you have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is set, or to reject all cookies. If you choose to reject all cookies some parts of our site may not work properly in your case.<br><br><br>
	<b>What security precautions are in place to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of your information?</b><br><br>
	At our site you can be assured that your Personally Identifiable Information is secure, consistent with current industry standards. The importance of security for all Personally Identifiable Information associated with our user is of utmost concern to us. We do not do any transmission of the Personally Identifiable Information collected through our website. Our service partners, who assist us in capturing and storing Personally Identifiable Information, are contractually bound not to share that information with any other party. Our company has a requisite information security policy in place with appropriate managerial, technical, operational and physical security control measures to protect the personal and non-personal information that is collected from website users.<br><br>
	Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your Personally Identifiable Information, you acknowledge that: (a) there are security and privacy limitations of the Internet which are beyond our control; (b) the security, integrity and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and us through this site cannot be guaranteed; and (c) any such information and data may be viewed or tampered with in transit by a third party.<br><br><br>
	<b>Do we use “cookies”?</b><br><br>
	We use cookies to improve the quality of the Website, to enhance user experience when visitors visit our Website and serve them better through customized content. Cookies allow OpexAI to monitor and analyze the usage of the Website. When you use our site we will store cookies on your computer in order to facilitate and customize your use of our site. A cookie is a small data text file, which a Website stores on your computer’s hard drive (if your Web browser permits) that can later be retrieved to identify you to us. Our cookies store randomly assigned user identification numbers, pages visited by a visitor, time spent on a page, clicks; demographic information about the visitor such as country, IP address, gender, age; technology, device and operating system used by the visitor. We do not capture names unless a visitor has voluntarily identified him or herself. We also use cookies to capture the Inferred Company Name or the Internet Service Provider from the IP address of the visitor. We use this information to find out what interests our visitors, segment our visitors and improve our website content and usability. We also use cookies for distinguishing users and user sessions and for identifying new users and sessions, to determine the traffic source that explains how the user reached our site and to throttle user request rate in order to limit the number of data requests in a time frame.<br><br>
	The cookies make your use of the site easier, make the site run more smoothly and help us to maintain a secure site. If a visitor has filled in a form such as Contact Us form or Content download form and has identified herself or himself, we may combine this information with other non-personally identifiable information that we receive about that visitor through cookies to analyze how he/she uses the Website in more detail.<br><br>
	You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, but some parts of our site may not work properly in that case. We do not use targeted cookies to deliver targeted advertising to website visitors.<br><br>
	<b>What should you know about privacy policies and data collection at any third party sites accessible from our site?</b><br><br>
	Except as otherwise discussed in this Privacy Policy, this document only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. OpexAI Business consulting LLP. does not allow any third party advertisements on its website.<br><br>
	<b>What else should you know about your privacy online?</b><br><br>
	You must be at least 18 years old to have our permission to use this site. Our policy is that we do not knowingly collect, use or disclose Personally Identifiable Information about visitors that are under 18 years of age.<br><br>
